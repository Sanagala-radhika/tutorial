💬 Generative AI Chatbot (HTML • CSS • JavaScript)

A simple yet powerful Generative AI Chatbot simulation built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project recreates the feel of a real AI assistant without any backend or API — perfect for beginners exploring how chatbots work.

🚀 Project Overview

This chatbot project demonstrates how generative responses can be simulated on the client side.
It responds to user messages with dynamic, context-aware text, mimicking a conversational AI like ChatGPT.

🧩 Features

💡 Generative Simulation: Produces natural, varied replies to user input.

🎨 Modern UI: Clean dark theme with smooth, responsive chat bubbles.

⚡ Real-Time Interaction: Messages appear instantly with a short delay for realism.

🧠 Offline Functionality: Runs entirely in the browser — no backend or API needed.

🧰 Lightweight: Only three files — index.html, style.css, and script.js.

🧠 How It Works

User types a message → JavaScript captures it.

The bot analyzes text patterns (e.g., “hi”, “help”, “bye”) and selects fitting replies.

For unknown inputs, it generates creative, randomized responses.

Smooth auto-scrolling keeps the chat natural and interactive.
